### How to Use
To run our project, the only technology required is an IDE such as Intellij with JDK 20 and a local MySQL
database connection. First, a user will need to execute our data dump in their local connection, done through an 
application like MySQL. To configure the connection from our Java project to their local MySQL connection, a user 
must change the 
`dbUrl`, `dbUsername`, and `dbPassword` fields in the 
`ConnectionUtil.java` class
located in `src/main/java.com.dishianerifkinj.util`. From there, our application is usable after building the application 
(either with the built-in build option in the IDE or with the `mvn clean install` command in the command line), 
then running the main method located in CommandLineApplication.java file, which is located in 
`src/main/java.com.dishianerifkinj`, runnable in the userâ€™s desired IDE. With our intuitive design, the user is guided 
through their interaction in the console with prompts, which will inquire the user to make actions based off of 
numerically ordered options, and text based queries.
